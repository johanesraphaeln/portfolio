              <p>Solving a puzzle game requires accuracy and intelligence.
                One of the most popular puzzle games today is Word Search Puzzle. Word Search Puzzle is a word search
                game in a collection of letters arranged randomly in the form of a two-dimensional array (matrix). This
                game can be solved with brute force and backtracking algorithms. This report will discuss brute force
                and backtracking, and its comparison in solving Word Search Puzzle based on the complexity and time
                efficiency of the program that the

                The first is a program that will ask for the name of the musician, then will enter it into a double

                the name of the composer, and the release date, the name of the composer can be more than one because
                musicians can collaborate with others, the song will be entered into a single linked list that is
                different
                from the Musicians double linked list. Then, the program will automatically connect the musicians
                with the existing song by looking for the name of the songwriter in the double linked list of musicians.
                The connection is done by creating a new single linked list in the Musician ADT, and the address of the
                song will be added to it.
